September 2015: Core Java Volume I, 8th ed.
===========================================

This is my second 25 day project. This activity consists of learning
Java concepts from the book, Core Java Volume I--Fundamentals, 8th ed.
written by Cay S. Horstmann and Gary Cornell, and writing example code
each day for 25 days.

Conclusion
----------

I started this project on 01 September 2015 and finished it on 31
December 2015. The project stretched for 4 months while my plan was
to complete it in 2 months considering other commitments. I intend to
learn advanced concepts of Java in future. I will plan better for my
next 25 day project and stick to the plan.
