June 2015: Learn JavaScript from MDN JavaScript Guide
=====================================================

One fine day in the year 2014, I decided to practise JavaScript. Getting
started was easy as I found [MDN JavaScript Guide] [T1]. I wrote a few
examples for a couple of days that followed. However, I did not devote
time regularly to learn JavaScript and eventually gave up. In June 2015,
I decided to do the learning as my first 25 day project. This activity
consists of learning JavaScript from MDN JavaScript Guide and writing
examples each day for 25 days.
